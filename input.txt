Create a visually appealing technical white paper titled "Next-Generation Neural Networks for Computer Vision"
that includes:
1. A detailed executive summary of the current state of neural networks in computer vision
2. Background on traditional computer vision approaches vs. deep learning
3. An in-depth analysis of at least 5 state-of-the-art neural network architectures for vision tasks
4. Performance comparison tables for these architectures across standard benchmarks
5. Visual representations of how each architecture processes image data
6. Case studies from at least 3 industries (healthcare, automotive, security)
7. Future research directions and challenges
8. A glossary of technical terms
The document should be highly technical but visually appealing with colored sections, highlighted key points,
and a modern look and feel. Use a two-column layout where appropriate, and make sure to include charts, boxed content for important information, and visually distinct tables.
